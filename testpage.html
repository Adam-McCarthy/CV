                   <h1>EL MORRO NATIONAL MONUMENT, NEW MEXICO</h1>


                                <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
  In the year 1540, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado came up from Mexico with
  some 350 Spanish soldiers and crossed southeastern Arizona to Zuñi, a
  pueblo 30 miles west of El Morro. Breaking up into several groups, they
  went eastward 70 miles to Acoma Pueblo and thence to the Rio Grande. At
  least one of the groups probably passed El Morro enroute.</p>

  <p>The first known historical mention of El Morro is found in the journal
  of Diego Pérez de Luxán, chronicler of the Espejo expedition of 1583.
  Luxán stopped here for water on March 11 of that year.</p>

  <p>For some 300 years, hundreds of Spanish soldiers and priests, enroute
  between Santa Fe and Zuñi, and the Hopi villages farther north, passed
  El Morro. Many left names and notations about themselves carved into the
  soft sandstone.</p>

  <p>After 1849, American soldiers, emigrants, freighters, and adventurers
  camped here because of the never-failing waterhole. In 1906, El Morro
  was set aside as a National Monument and additional name carving was
  prohibited.</p>

  <p>The name “El Morro” simply means “the headland” or “the bluff,” and
  refers to the appearance of this mesa-point from a distance.</p>

                          <h2> KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL</h2>




                          <h2> INSCRIPTION ROCK TRAIL</h2>


  <p>The trail begins directly behind the Monument headquarters, and climbs
  gradually toward the rock. Just follow the arrows and _do not hurry_. It
  is 7,200 feet above sea level here, and the altitude may bother some of
  you. The hike past the inscriptions and back to the office normally
  takes from 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

  <p>After viewing the inscriptions, you may, if you wish, continue up over
  the top of the rock and visit two large prehistoric Indian ruins. This
  extra hike will take you another 1 to 1½ hours.</p>

  <p>Starting near the base of the mesa the trail has been marked with
  numbered stations which match the numbered paragraphs in this booklet.
  Read and enjoy yourself as you walk.</p>

  <p>No one has ever been bitten here, but watch along the path for
  rattlesnakes.</p>

            <h3> Please leave the Monument as neat as you found it.</h3>


  <p>1.   If you look closely at the rock, about 12 feet above the ground,
  you will see some notches cut into the sandstone. These are footholds.
  Probably most Indians came to the pool by the long, safe way, but
  others, caring more for their thirst than their lives, came down from
  the mesa top through the high notch to the right and above you.</p>

    <p>Do not, under any circumstances, try coming down this short way—the
    rock is extremely slippery. If you go to the top, stay on the marked
                                   trail.</p>


  <p>2.   Now you see why travelers stopped here. There is no spring; the
  pool is fed largely by rain falling in July, August, and September, and
  by melting snows. When full it is about 12 feet deep and holds about
  200,000 gallons of water.</p>

                      <h2> DO NOT THROW ANYTHING INTO THE POOL!</h2>

  <p>If you look closely around the walls at about eye level, even on the far
  side, you can see names carved into the rock. Most of these date from
  1850 to 1900, and were the work of emigrants and soldiers.</p>

  <p>How did they get over there? In the early days, there was probably a
  sandbank around the edge, and people could ride or walk around the pool.
  In 1942, a heavy rock fall filled the waterhole. When the sand and
  rubble were removed, the old dam was reinforced and lined with concrete.</p>

    <p>Do not write or carve on the cliff, and please don’t touch. Touching
    the inscriptions causes them to wear away more rapidly.</p>

  <p>The mud formations on the face of the rock above the pool are the nests
  of cliff swallows. These birds come to El Morro each year to nest and
  raise their young.</p>
